For our project for CS564, we looked into global video game sales. The database entries include important qualifiers,
such as year, sales, region, and critic/user rating. Our application is built in Java with frontend being created in
javascript. There are over 16,000 entries in the dataset we are utilizing, each with an abundance of information for
every game included. The data is from Steam's database in 2019. Analyzing video game sales is important for people working in the game development field. Having 
the ability to analyze sales trends can help developers determine what genre to choose for their games. This in turn 
can help publishers generate more profit by optimizing cost of development while also prioritizing revenue.
